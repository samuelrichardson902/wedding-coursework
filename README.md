# Wedding Coursework

This repository contains the code for my university coursework project, which focuses on building a wedding planning platform. The project demonstrates the use of web technologies to create an interactive experience for users to browse and select wedding venues and services.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- PHP
- CSS
- HTML

## Demo

To view the site, clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

The site will then be available at [http://localhost:8000/wedding.php](http://localhost:8000/wedding.php)
